# rps-project
This project creates a Rock Paper Scissors game Application
Create a javascript game that is accessed via the browserâ€™s console via the function playGame(). 
When the game is launched, it should ask the player how many rounds they want to play.  Then it will go through each round asking the player to choose rock, paper, scissors, and then choosing one of those randomly for the computer. 
At the beginning of each new round, the current score should be displayed and a final score also at the very end.
